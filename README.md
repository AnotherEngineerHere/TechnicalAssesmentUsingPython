# Technical assesment

During this Technical assesment we develop two exercises, the first one is to set an algorithm to solve this, for this i tried to approaches, the first one was brute force, but it was not fullfill the requeriments.

The other one was a stairs, snake game, the instructions will be uploaded in the repository 


# Requeriments

For runnig the project is necessary to instal Python 3.10

I use Spyder, but it will work if your local installation by using python running

Both project have bonuses, the first one is not done, the second one the only one done was if the player has a position over 25 it gets back to a previous position
